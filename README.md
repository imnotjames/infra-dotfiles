# Project Infra Dotfiles
## Giving Everyone the Heroku Experience

`infra` is an opinionated set of schemas and command-line tools to describe and manage
your applications as configuration.  Define a project, applications, and pipelines -
then let infra take care of the rest.

Use `infra` to

* Deploy your latest and greatest application to kubernetes clusters
* Provision third party resources as part of a deploy, such as databases,
  monitoring tools, and more
* Manage a platform-agnostic CI/CD pipeline
* Define ownership across a repository
* Record metadata that is the glue between your team and your application

See the documentation to learn more about the concepts and configurations available.
